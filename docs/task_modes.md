# Task Modes

LibCrowds Viewer provides three annotation modes: select, transcribe and
review.

## Select mode

In select mode the user can use a rectangle drawing tool to highlight areas of
the image. This might be used to pick out all regions of an image that match
the task objective.

For an example of the input and output for this type of task see the
[Select Annotations](/annotations/select.md) section.

## Transcribe mode

In transcribe mode the user is given a form and asked to transcribe a
particular set of data. The data transcribed may relate to the image as a
whole, or to a prticular region of the image previously highlighted in select
mode.

For an example of the input and output for this type of task see the
[Transcribe Annotations](/annotations/transcribe.md) section.

## Review mode

In review mode the user can view and update a list of annotations, such as
those previously generated by select or transcribe tasks.

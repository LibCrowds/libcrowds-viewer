# Events

LibCrowds Viewer doesn't manage the persistance of Annotations. This is left to be implemented in whatever way the client chooses. Instead, the component follows the standard Vue parent-child relationship of props down, events up. After initialisation all tasks and annotations are only modified locally, with any changes emitted via events.

Note that the viewer creates Annotations with a random ID, so this should be updated and tracked by the client (for instance, using one generated by an Annotation server).

The following events are emitted from the viewer.

| Event      | Arguments        | Description          |
|------------|------------------|----------------------|
| submit     | task             | User input confirmed |
| update     | task, annotation | Annotation updated   |
| create     | task, annotation | Annotation created   |
| delete     | task, annotation | Annotation deleted   |
| taskchange | oldTask, newTask | Task changed         |
| taskliked  | task             | Task liked/unliked   |
